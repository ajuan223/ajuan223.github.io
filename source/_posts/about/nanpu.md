## Nanpu

Nanpu is a city built by Hanyan, who is also the tutelary of it.  
This city is inhabited by creatures who work hard to make their dreams come true. We are engaged in their dream professions and are building this fantasy country together.  
If I have time, I'll write down Hanyan's story as well. Or he would like to tell you himslef.

### Four patriarchs

In addition to the castle lord, there are four elders responsible for maintaining order in the city, who are the friends of the castle lord, settled here since the early days of the city's existence.  
Each elder has a unique code name. Mine is 'Yun,' which means 'cloud' in English, symbolizing my faith in freedom, mystery, and sacredness.
Although I needed wine instead of blood intake and always looked like I was drunk, 'wine' is the name of 'Shen Juan'. He runs a tavern.  
The other two are codenamed Tea and Sugar, origin from their usual preferences.
