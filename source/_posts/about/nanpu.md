## Nanpu

Nanpu is a city built by Hanyan, who is also the tutelary of it.  
This city is inhabited by creatures who work hard to make their dreams come true. We are engaged in their dream professions and are building this fantasy country together.  
If I have time, I'll write down Hanyan's story as well. Or he would like to tell you himslef.

### Four patriarchs

In addition to the castle lord, there are four elders who are responsible for maintaining order in the city, and they are friends of the castle lord who has settled here since the early days of the city's existence.
They have their own code names, and mine is wine. Because I needed wine instead of blood intake and always looked like I was drunk.
